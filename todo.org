** Correct the routing in function of the movement direction                    :Marco:

*** Average the GPS signal before starting to move

** If we can do traffic sign recognition, it would be nice, but not a priority  :~:

*** Template benching                                                           :Matteo:

** Obstacle recognition (Pedestrian, car, roadblock)                            :Sari:Mohamed:Matteo:

** Training the CNN for intersection and roundabout navigation                  :Mohamed:Miguel:

** Check why we set the camera driver at 1640x1232 but then caputure at 320x240

** Setting the default value of car.trust_gps to false breaks the brain         :Miguel:

** Move IMU away from the motor                                                 :Marco:

** Move flags and stuff to the main                                             :Miguel:

** WHEEL_LEN, GPS_CONVERGENCE_PATIANCE are not used

** Consider creating a special maneauver to exit the junction

** Unify stopline detection (only advanced?)

* Weekly meetings: Tuesday 09h00

* PRIORITY: CNN

* First resolution to try for obstacle detection: 160x120

* Tell Bosch that Bruschetta will be there only from the 3rd to the 7th

* From last year

- yaw checking
- stopline detetcion retrain (in progress)
- measure delay and freq of gps
- pedestrian on crosswalk with gps
- add yolo for classification
