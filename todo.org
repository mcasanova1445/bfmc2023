** Correct the routing in function of the movement direction                    :Marco:

*** Average the GPS signal before starting to move

** If we can do traffic sign recognition, it would be nice, but not a priority  :~:

** Training the CNN for intersection and roundabout navigation                  :Mohamed:Miguel:

** Check why we set the camera driver at 1640x1232 but then caputure at 320x240

* Weekly meetings: Tuesday 09h00

* PRIORITY: CNN

* First resolution to try for obstacle detection: 160x120

* Tell Bosch that Bruschetta will be there only from the 3rd to the 7th

* From last year

- yaw checking
- stopline detetcion retrain (in progress)
- measure delay and freq of gps
- pedestrian on crosswalk with gps
- add yolo for classification
