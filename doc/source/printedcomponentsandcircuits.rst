Printed components and circuit boards
=========================================

Printed components - 3D
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

On the robot we use four 3d printed components: Nucleo and Raspberry Pi 4 support, Camera base holder, Camera joint 1, Camera joint 2. 
The 3d models of these components you download from following links:
    
    - `Nucleo and Raspberry Pi 4 suport`_
    - `Camera base`_
    - `Camera joint 1`_
    - `Camera joint 2`_

On the race track we place elements that are printed or built. The model for these posts you can download from following links:
    - `Traffic sign base`_
    - `Traffic sign pole`_
    - `Separator block`_

Printed circuit boards (PCB's)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On the robot we built two pcb's, a power distribution board and a BNO shuttleboard. You can view and download them from the following links:
    - `Power Distribution Board`_
    - `BNO shuttleboard`_
